## Everything is a page

"Modern" CMSs seem to differentiate between so-called "posts" and "pages". Posts having additional metadata, such as author and publish date.

On my site, everything is written by me. Furthermore, all pages have an explicit published and last-modified date. So, no need to make stuff needlessly complicated: everything is a post.

Every page has a slug, which is that path after the URL.

## Volumes

The site is divided into so-called volumes. This is an idea that I've stolen from @devastatia, who lists her posts per year on her homepage, with "Volume 1" and "Volume 2" as titles.
